## StopWatch Web Application
---
<p> Task -Here, I use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a web application that acts as a stopwatch. HTML is used to organise the application's components. Users can precisely measure and record time intervals by implementing functions for the stopwatch, such as starting, pausing, and resetting it, as well as tracking and <b> displaying lap times </b>. I have developed a stopwatch web application that is both interactive and user-friendly using these technologies and functionalities. </p>

<p> Languages Used: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript </p>
